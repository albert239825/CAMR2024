22 Abstract
23 Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has advanced our understanding of cellular 
24 heterogeneity at the single-cell resolution by classifying and characterizing cell types in 
25 multiple tissues and species. While several mouse retinal scRNA-seq reference datasets have 
26 been published, each dataset either has a relatively small number of cells or is focused on 
27 specific cell classes, and thus is suboptimal for assessing gene expression patterns across all 
28 retina types at the same time. To establish a unified and comprehensive reference for the 
29 mouse retina, we first generated the largest retinal scRNA-seq dataset to date, comprising 
30 approximately 190,000 single cells from C57BL/6J mouse whole retinas. This dataset was 
31 generated through the targeted enrichment of rare population cells via antibody-based 
32 magnetic cell sorting. By integrating this new dataset with public datasets, we conducted an
33 integrated analysis to construct the Mouse Retina Cell Atlas (MRCA) for wild-type mice, which 
34 encompasses over 330,000 single cells. The MRCA characterizes 12 major classes and 138 cell 
35 types. It captured consensus cell type characterization from public datasets and identified 
36 additional new cell types. To facilitate the public use of the MRCA, we have deposited it in
37 CELLxGENE, UCSC Cell Browser, and the Broad Single Cell Portal for visualization and gene 
38 expression exploration. The comprehensive MRCA serves as an easy-to-use, one-stop data 
39 resource for the mouse retina communities.

41 Introduction
42 The retina is a highly heterogenous part of the eye that captures and processes the 
light signal 1-3 43 . The processing is enabled through five classes of retinal neurons: 
44 photoreceptors (PR), horizonal cells (HC), bipolar cells (BC), amacrine cells (AC), and retinal 
45 ganglion cells (RGC), which form an intricate circuitry necessary for processing and relaying
46 the light signal to the visual cortex. Non-neuronal cells such as Müller glia cells(MG), microglia,
47 astrocytes, and retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) provide structural integrity of the tissue 
48 and carry out various supporting roles such as metabolism and neuronal homeostasis in the 
retinal microenvironment 4,5 49 . Characterization of distinct retinal cell types is, therefore, critical 
50 in advancing our understanding of the fine intricacies of cell interactions involved in retinal 
51 biology and visual disorders.

52 Single cell technologies have opened a window into knowledge of cellular 
53 heterogeneity and intricate cell-to-cell interactions that cannot currently be resolved at the 
54 tissue level and have allowed exploration of individual cellular expression signatures, which 
can be mapped to unique molecular cell types 6,7 55 . The resulting cell atlas can serve as a 
56 foundation for numerous applications, including the annotation of cell types in other scRNAseq experiments 8 57 , the identification of differentially expressed targets for purification or 
manipulation 9 58 , and the generation of marker panels useful for single-molecule imaging,
including spatial profiling 10 59 . While studies have demonstrated cell type heterogeneities in 
60 various tissues, several perplexing issues remain to be addressed in establishing a 
61 comprehensive cell atlas such as the agreement on cell type definitions across different 
62 experiments or whether enough cells have been profiled to exhaust all existing cell types.
63 Integrated analyses of various scRNA-seq datasets from different studies, therefore, can 
64 provide an important insight that comprehensively addresses such issues.
65 The mouse retina provides an important model for the study of neurobiology, with
more than 130 distinct cell types characterized through previous scRNA-seq studies 7,9,11-15 66 .
However, the scRNA-seq datasets have been generated separately for BC 11, AC 12 67 , and RGC
9,13,14 68 , with the largest dataset containing just under 36,000 cells, making it difficult to use in 
69 aggregate. Though most of these datasets are independently browsable on the Broad Single 
Cell Portal 16 70 and accessible through separate databasessuch as the Gene Expression Omnibus 
71 (GEO) repository, it can be challenging to assess gene expression patterns across all retinal cell 
72 types. Ensuring these atlases define a complete set of retinal cell types remains a major 
73 challenge that can only be addressed by powering studies to sufficiently profile the rarest 
74 retinal cell types. Here, we generated scRNA-seq data of over 189,000 cellsin the mouse retina
to complement 141,000 cells from six publicly available scRNA-seq datasets 9,11-15 75 , creating a
76 unified cell atlas of the wild-type mouse retina containing over 330,000 cells. Our integrated 
77 analysis presents a comprehensive characterization of all major cell classes in the retina,
78 including non-neuronal types, as well as a consensus cell type annotation of BCs, ACs, and 
79 RGCs. Accessible, interactive web browsers have facilitated easy visualization of atlas
80 characterizations and exploration of gene expression in the MRCA. The comprehensive unified 
81 MRCA will serve as a valuable resource for the community.

83 Results

85 Generation of scRNA-seq dataset for wild-type mouse retina
86 To establish a comprehensive atlas of the mouse retina, we performed scRNA-seq 
87 profiling with C57BL/6J mouse retina tissue samples, aged from P14 to 12 months, for over 
88 189,000 cells (Fig. 1a and Methods). As summarized in Table 1, six samples of varying ages
89 were dissociated retinal cells without enrichment, and ten samples of eight weeks old were
90 enriched using surface markers CD73 and CD90.1 to enrich for rare cell population. Depletion 
91 of rod photoreceptors was achieved by removing cells positive for CD73 using anti-CD73-PE 
92 antibody and anti-PE magnetic beads, which primarily label photoreceptor precursors and 
mature rod photoreceptors in mice 12,17 93 . To enrich ACs and RGCs, CD90.1 positive cells are 
selected 18,19 94 .
95
96 Integration of scRNA-seq datasets for the mouse retina
97 To compile the most comprehensive scRNA-seq data for the MRCA, we curated and 
98 obtained six publicly available scRNA-seq datasets, each enriched for a specific cell type using 
99 transgenic labels or immunolabeling combined with FACS. Together, they consisted of over 
100 141,000 cells. To consolidate the transcript annotation between different datasets, we used 
101 the Cell Ranger (version 7.0.1) pipeline to align raw FASTQ files from four datasets obtained 
102 from GEO and Sequence Read Archive (SRA) repositories. Count matrices of these datasets

103 were generated using the mm10 reference genome obtained from 10x Genomics 
104 (https://cf.10xgenomics.com/supp/cell-exp/refdata-gex-mm10-2020-A.tar.gz). Five of the 
105 published studies were sequenced on the 10x Genomics 3’ platform, and one (Shekhar et al.)
was generated using the Drop-seq protocol 7 106 . The Drop-seq data were aligned against mm10 
107 and processed into count matrices using the Drop-seq pipeline
108 (https://github.com/broadinstitute/Drop-seq). The cell type labels of previous annotations
were obtained from the Broad Single Cell Portal website 16 109 . To remove technical variations 
introduced across different experiments or studies, scVI 20 110 was applied to integrate all newly
111 generated and public datasets, generating a low-dimensional representation (Fig. 1b and 
112 Methods). Putative cell doublets were further removed using the deep learning doublet 
identification method Solo 21 113 (Supplementary Fig. 1a).
114 In the integrated data, the public dataset accounts for 43%, while the newly generated 
115 data accounts for the remaining 57% (Fig. 1c). Within the integrated UMAP, 97 clusters were 
116 identified (Supplementary Fig. 1b). These clusters were annotated as one of 12 major classes, 
117 including PR, BC, AC, RGC, HC, MG, RPE, astrocyte, microglial, endothelial, and pericyte, using 
known marker gene expression 22,23 118 (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Cells from non-enriched retina 
119 samples showed a distribution across major classes at an expected proportion, with rod 
photoreceptors as the biggest proportion 2 120 . In contrast, enriched samples from both newly 
121 generated data and previous studies showed the expected skewed distribution of cell types in 
122 BCs, ACs, and RGCs (Supplementary Fig. 1d). The two newly generated samples with 
enrichment methods, CD73- and CD90.1+ 123 samples, were primarily composed of BCs and ACs, 
124 respectively, contributing to 83% (122.6K out of 147.7K) and 25% (11.2K out of 44K) of all BCs
125 and ACs in the integrated data, respectively.
Previous studies have identified 15 distinct types of BCs, 64 ACs, and 46 RGCs 9,11,12 126 . To 
127 determine the consensus annotation of neuronal types for these subclasses, we performed 
128 clustering analysis at higher resolution within individual BC, AC, and RGC classes (Fig. 1d and 
129 Fig. 1e).
130
131 15 types of bipolar cells
132 A total of 147,700 BCs were identified in the integrated datasets, with 122,600 cells 
from our newly generated CD73- sample and 19,800 cells from the Shekhar et al. study 11 133 . The 
134 integrated analysis identified 15 BC clusters, corresponding to previously annotated BC types 
135 (Fig. 2a-b and Methods). The 15 clusters of integrated BCs showed a generally even 
136 distribution of cells from various samples, with the exception of two types, BC1A and BC1B, 
137 where more than 90% of populations came from the study by Shekhar et al. possibly due to
138 differences in enrichment methods (Fig. 2a, 2d and Supplementary Fig. 2d-e). The final 
139 annotation of BCs revealed consistent expression profiles of previously identified BC type 
marker genes 11,24 140 (Fig. 2b-c). With a significant addition of BCs in the MRCA, clear separation 
141 of BC8 and BC9 is observed, which were merged but demonstrated substructure in the 
142 Shekhar et al. dataset (Fig. 2a-b). The separate clusters showed proper expression patterns of 
known markers like Cpen9 in BC9 11,25 143 . In addition, additional BC type markers were identified 
144 via differential gene expression analysis, which showed more specific expressions than
145 previous marker genes, such as Tafa4 in BC4, Ptprt in BC5A, and Gm13986 in BC8 (Fig. 2e).
146 Interestingly, despite an almost ten-fold increase in the number of BCs in our analysis, we did 
147 not observe any sign of a novel cell type, which suggests that the mature mouse retina likely 
148 only contains 15 BC types.
149
150 Amacrine cells
151 Through CD90.1 positive enrichment, the newly generated samples contributed 
11,200 ACs, in addition to the 27,600 ACs from Yan et al. 12 152 in the integrated dataset
153 (Supplementary Fig. 3a-b). Utilizing the collected data, the integrated analysis annotated 63 
154 AC types, revealing consistent expression profiles of known marker genes (Fig. 3a-b and

155 Methods). While a minimal batch effect in each cluster was observed across different sample 
sources, CD90.1+ 156 and Ma et al. RGC samples showed biased enrichment towards GABAergic 
157 types except for AC4, AC10, and AC28 (Supplementary Fig. 4e). The bias in cell type population 
158 appears to be directly tied to the preferential expression of Thy1 (CD90) in sub-populations of
159 ACs (Supplementary Fig. 4d). In particular, Thy1 is characterized as being expressed primarily 
in GABAergic AC types 26 160 .
161 The integrated analysis of ACs demonstrated that four types, AC18, AC20, AC36, and 
162 AC45, have been previously under-clustered, each splitting into two clusters in the integrated 
UMAP (Fig. 3c). AC18, which expresses Cck neuropeptide 27 163 , is split into C24 and C27 in our 
164 clustering and has been labeled as AC18A and AC18B in the final annotation (Fig. 3d).
165 Interestingly, the cell type marker Cck is highly expressed in AC18A, but not in AC18B
166 (Supplementary Fig. 5a). AC20, which does not contain any known marker, is divided into C42 
167 and C60 (AC20A and AC20B), with its marker Sema3a also expressed highly in AC20A, but not 
168 in AC20B (Supplementary Fig. 5b). A non-GABAergic non-glycinergic (nGnG) type 4, AC36, is 
169 split into C58 and C61 (AC36A and AC36B), consistent with previous finding of two 
170 morphologically distinct AC36 types in the INL and displaced in the GCL, stratifying to S3 and 
S5 sublaminae of the IPL 10,28 171 . By examining the list of differentially expressed genes (DEG) 
between the two broadly isolated types 28 172 , we annotated AC36A as the S3 type by the 
173 increased markers such as Gbx2, Tac1, and Pcdh8 and AC36B as the S5 type by Gad1, Gad2, 
and Id4. (Fig. 3e). Lastly, a catecholaminergic type 1 cell type 29 174 , AC45, is split into C64 and C66
175 (AC45A and AC45B). The expression of Chl1, which distinguishes catecholaminergic type 1 
176 from type 2, was increased specifically in AC45A. The DEG analysis between the clusters of the 
177 previously under-clustered cell type revealed many genes enriched specifically in each cluster, 
178 with Cck, Sema3a, Chl1 being one of the top-ranked genes in AC18A, AC20A and AC45A, 
179 respectively (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Out of the four under-clustered cell types, only one,
180 AC20, showed a biased sample source from Yan et al. data. Furthermore, while cells from Yan
181 et al. were distributed across both AC45A and AC45B, AC45B contains an increased number of 
182 cells from the newly generated CD90.1 sample (Supplementary Fig. 4e).
183 As a result, we have identified 67 AC types that can be grouped into four AC 
184 subclasses: 49 GABAergic, 10 Glycinergic, 3 Both, and 5 nGnG ACs. Within the final dataset,
185 GABAergic ACs make up 67.7% of the total AC population, followed by Glycinergic ACs at 
186 22.5%, GABA/Glycinergic ACs at 1%, and nGnG ACs at 8.7%. However, these distributions are 
likely biased towards GABAergic ACs due to the inclusion of cells from CD90.1+ and CD90.2+ 187
188 enriched collections.
189
190 Retinal ganglion cells
191 The integrated data contains 77,900 RGCs, primarily from the three publicly available 
192 datasets. The integration of the collected data identified all 46 previously identified RGC types
193 (Fig. 4a and Methods). Examination of known cell type markers in the integrated data with the 
final annotation showed proper expression profiles in corresponding types 9,18,30 194 (Fig. 4b).
195 Although no novel cluster was identified, our integrated analysis of RGCs similarly identified 
196 the division of two cell types, 16_ooDS_DV (ON-OFF direction-selective dorsal and ventral) and 
197 18_Novel, into distinct clusters (Fig. 4c). The 16_ooDS_DV, which contains both types with 
dorsal and ventral orientation selective functional roles 31,32 198 , wassplit into C31 and C39,similar 
to the supervised clustering analysis done in the Tran et al. 9
, Jacobi et al. 13, and Ma et al. 14 199
200 studies. Examination of the marker genes Calb1 and Calb2 demonstrated that C39 is the 
201 ventral selective type with high expression of Calb2, and C31 is the dorsal selective type with 
Calb1 expression 9 202 . In addition, the 18_Novel type could also be split into C36 and C40.
203 Interestingly, while C40 contained only cells with 18_Novel labels, C36 contained a mixture of 
204 18_Novel and 44_Novel labels (Supplementary Fig. 7a-c). The same annotation improvements 
were also observed in Ma et al.14 205 . Examination of 18_Novel markers Pcdh20 and 
206 4833424E24Rik revealed increased expression of both markers in C40, yet Pcdh20 expression

207 was absent in C36 (Supplementary Fig. 7e). The DEG analysis further demonstrated many 
208 genes selectively expressed in these two clusters (Supplementary Fig. 7d). In total, we have 
209 identified 47 RGC types in the MRCA (Fig. 4d).
210
211 Non-neuronal retinal cells
212 To include the comprehensive set of cell types in the retina in the MRCA, 18,500 non213 neuronal cells were integrated for six non-neuronal cell types, including astrocyte, endothelial, 
214 MG, microglia, pericyte, and RPE (Supplementary Fig. 8a and Fig. 1e). These cells are evenly 
215 distributed in the collected datasets, except for astrocytessolely from the Benhar et al. dataset 15 216 (Supplementary Fig. 8b). After being combined with neuronal retinal cells, the MRCA 
217 consisted of 12 major classes and 138 cell types.
218
219 Data dissemination at accessible interactive web browsers
220 The MRCA has been made available for public access using the CELLxGENE platform 
221 (https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/collections/a0c84e3f-a5ca-4481-b3a5-ccfda0a81ecc and 
222 https://mouseatlas.research.bcm.edu/) (Fig. 5a-c). The MRCA is also accessible on UCSC Cell 
223 Browser (https://retina.cells.ucsc.edu) and the Broad Single Cell Portal. Pre-computed gene 
224 expression profiles of all cells included in the integrated analysis can be examined and 
225 visualized. Users also have access to the metadata information, including major class and cell 
226 type labels in the database. The accessible interactive web browsers of the MRCA can aid in 
227 easy access to the transcriptome profiles of any given mouse retinal cells without the 
228 bioinformatic burden and provides a valuable tool for the vision community.
229
230 Discussion
231 As part of the central nervous system, the retina contains numerous neuronal types 
with distinct morphologies and functional roles 1,33 232 . The heterogenous cell type composition
233 and the stereotypically patterned structure of the tissue makes the retina an ideal model for 
single-cell sequencing studies in establishing the single-cell atlas 7,22,34 234 . Although several 
scRNA-seq studies focusing on the retina tissue have been done previously 7,9,11-15 235 , each 
236 available dataset contains single-cell profiles primarily of one or a few retinal cell classes with 
237 a limited number of cells. Furthermore, no systematic evaluation or comparison of the 
238 datasets has been done yet to cross-validate the cell type transcriptomes and address 
239 annotation consensus.
240 In this study, we generated scRNA-seq profiles of 189,000 retinal cells from 16 scRNA241 seq experiments to perform an integrated analysis with 141,000 retinal cells from six 
242 previously reported datasets. Six out of the newly generated collections were done using
243 endogenous retina tissues with simple dissociation and without enrichment. Photoreceptors 
constitute over 70% of the cell proportion in the retina 2,35 244 , and there are only two subclasses
245 of photoreceptors, which are well studied. Therefore, we utilized two methods for rare 
246 population cell type enrichment. The first way was depleting the rod photoreceptors. To 
247 achieve this goal, the rod photoreceptor cell surface marker, CD73, was used in seven of the 
248 16 experiments. Though this marker is generally considered as a specific marker for rod 
249 photoreceptors, it is also expressed on the surface of a subset of ACs, HCs, and MGs. Depletion
250 increased the enrichment of BCs from 12% to 90%. Furthermore, CD90.1 was used to enrich 
251 certain retinal neurons such as ACs and RGCs in three experiments. Enrichment of retinal cells 
252 with CD90.1 also showed an increased number of ACs with some RGCs.
253 One of the challenges in integrating and comparing publicly available data is that they 
are generated using different single-cell experimental platforms and analysis pipelines 36,37 254 .
One public data enriched with BCs from Shekhar et al. 11 was generated using the Drop-seq 7 255
256 technology and was processed separately using the Cell Ranger transcript annotation. The four 
257 other sources of publicly available data were done using the 10x Genomics platform. A minimal
258 batch effect across data sources was observed in the integrated analysis, with the expected 
perpetuity. It is made available under aCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.

259 distribution and clustering of major classes from corresponding sources. While the newly
260 generated data without enrichment were primarily composed of rod photoreceptors, cells
261 from the newly generated data with enrichment and publicly available data showed a proper 
262 distribution across BCs, AC, and RGCs.
263 Integrated analysis of various scRNA-seq datasets allowed us to examine AC, BC, and 
264 RGC types, which together comprise over 100 distinct cell types. Through the integrated 
265 analysis, we addressed two key questions on the neuronal cell types in the retina: to confirm 
266 the consensus cell type signatures and to examine whether the total number of cell types of
267 retinal neurons is exhausted. Following the initial integrated analysis to identify major classes, 
268 subsets of each major class were subjected to further integration and two-level clustering to
269 annotate all previously identified cell types, which showed an even distribution of data sources 
270 in general. The cell type annotation was achieved through examining known marker gene 
271 expressions and previous annotation labels when available. Although our newly generated 
272 data resulted in a significantly increased number of cells in the integrated analysis of BCs, ACs, 
273 and RGCs, we did not observe significant increases of novel cluster. As such, the previously 
274 reported set of BC types in the adult mouse retina is likely complete, supported by the more 
275 than 7-fold increase in BCs in the integrated data. On the other hand, our integrated analysis 
276 updates annotations of AC and RGC types. In particular, we observed several instances of 
277 previously under-clustered AC and RGC types splitting into distinct clusters in our analysis. For 
278 example, we confirmed the separation of 16_ooDS_DV types into two distinct clusters in the 
279 integrated data of RGCs, which was separated into dorsal and ventral selective types only 
through supervised clustering in the Tran et al. study 9 and later confirmed in Jacobi et al. 13 280
281 study. Furthermore, we identified the separation of AC36 and assigned its clusters to S3 and 
S5, stratifying Gbx2+ AC types28 282 , which strengthens our analysis by connecting to biologically 
283 distinct cell types. The separation of previously merged cell types into distinct clusters can be 
284 attributed to the increased number of cells in our integrated analysis. Thissuggeststhat, while 
285 our AC and RGC type annotations are comprehensive, they will likely continue to be refined 
286 by future studies.
287 Finally, we have deposited the MRCA into interactive web browsers that are user288 friendly and publicly accessible. This allows for the examination of raw and normalized gene 
289 expression profiles of all retinal cells, along with their metadata such as major class and cell 
290 type annotation. The MRCA not only provides the consensus signature of mouse retinal cell 
291 types by comparing multiple scRNA-seq data but also alleviates the bioinformatics burden for
292 many vision researchers who wish to examine transcriptome signatures in any cell type of their 
293 interest.

295 Methods
296
297 Generation of scRNA-seq datasets of the mouse retina
298 We have generated 16 scRNA-seq samples of the mouse C57BL/6J retina (Table 1). All
299 mice were male. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use 
300 Committee (IACUC) and followed the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology 
301 (ARVO) Statements for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research, in addition to 
302 the guidelines for laboratory animal experiments (Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, 
303 Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals). After dissection, 
304 retinas were dissociated into single cells using papain-based enzyme following the published 
protocol38 305 . With activated 45U of papain (Worthington, Cat. #LS003126) solution (1mg L306 Cystine, Sigma; 8 KU of DNase I, Affymetrix; in 5 ml DPBS), retina was incubated at 37C for

311 with additional 1ml ovomucoid solution until no tissue was visible. Single-cell suspension was 
312 spun down at 300g, 4C for 10 min and used in the next step.
313 To deplete the photoreceptors, cells were resuspended in 0.5% BSA and stained with 
314 CD73-PE antibody (MACS, Catalog: 130-102-616) for 10min at 4C (for each million cells, add 
315 98ul 0.5% BSA with 2ul CD73-PE antibody) and washed with 35 ml 0.5% BSA at 4C for 10min.
316 After being stained with Anti-PE microbeads (MACS, Catalog: 130-105-639) (80ul 0.5% BSA and 
317 20ul microbeads per each million cells) for 15 min at 4C, cells were washed and resuspended 
318 in 0.5% BSA. CD73 negative neuronal cells were enriched by autoMACS Pro Separator(Miltenyi 
319 Biotec) DEPLETES mode. Similarly, CD90.1 positive neuronal cells were enriched with CD90.1
320 microbeads (MACS, LOT: 130-094-523; 90ul 0.5% BSA and 10ul CD90.1 microbeads per each 
321 million cells) and autoMACS POSSEL-S mode. Cells viability was 87%-94% when checked using
322 DAPI staining under microscope.
323 Guided by 10X manufacturer’s protocols (https://www.10xgenomics.com), single-cell 
324 cDNA library was prepared and sequenced. Briefly, single-cell suspension was loaded on a 
325 Chromium controller to obtain single cell GEMS (Gel Beads-In-Emulsions) for the reaction. The 
326 library was prepared with Chromium Next GEM single cell 3’ kit V2 (10X Genomics) and 
327 sequenced on Illumina Novaseq 6000 (https://www.illumina.com). Our newly generated 
328 single cell data was sequenced at the Single Cell Genomics Core at Baylor College of Medicine.

330 Data collection and preprocessing of the mouse retinal scRNA-seq
331 To recover high-quality cells, data samples were processed through a quality control 
332 pipeline (https://github.com/lijinbio/cellqc). In brief, raw sequencing reads of 10x Genomics
were first analyzed by the 10x Genomics Cell Ranger pipeline (version 7.0.1) 39 333 using the mm10 
334 genome reference obtained from 10x Genomics (https://cf.10xgenomics.com/supp/cell335 exp/refdata-gex-mm10-2020-A.tar.gz). Potential empty droplets in the filtered feature count 
matrices were further detected by dropkick 40 336 . Background transcripts contamination in the 
retained true cells were eliminated using SoupX 41 337 . DoubletFinder then was utilized to estimate 
and exclude potential doublets with high proportions of simulated artificial doublets 42 338 . In the 
339 resulting singlets, we extracted high-feature cells that contain ≥ 300 features, ≥ 500
340 transcript counts, and ≤10% of reads mapped to mitochondrial genes.
341 In addition to our own data, we have incorporated well-characterized public datasets. 
342 Specifically, we have integrated cell-type-enhanced profiling data for amacrine cells 
(accession: GSE149715) 12, bipolar cells (accession: GSE81904) 11 343 , and retinal ganglion cells 
(accession: GSE133382) 9 344 . Furthermore, we have included four samples from wild-type mice 
were also collected from GSE201254 to account for retinal ganglion cells 13 345 . To account for 
non-neuronal retinal cells, nine control samples were collected from GSE199317 15 346 . These cell347 type specific single-cell datasets form the basis for subclass clustering in our mouse retina 
348 reference. To generate the updated transcriptome measurement of the GSE81904 from 
349 Shekhar et al., which was derived from the Drop-seq protocol, we applied the Drop-seq 
350 pipeline using the source code available at https://github.com/broadinstitute/Drop-seq. To 
351 ensure consistent gene feature annotation with the Cell Ranger pipeline, we used the gene 
352 annotation GTF file from the 10x Genomics mm10 genome reference package during the 
353 alignment of Drop-seq reads. In addition, GSE149715, GSE133382, GSE201254, and 
354 GSE199317 were also processed from scratch using raw sequencing reads using the 10x 
Genomics Cell Ranger pipeline (version 7.0.1) 39 355 . To incorporate the high-quality cell type 
356 annotation of four public datasets, released count matrices and cell labeling were downloaded 
357 for meta-analysis. To further eliminate potential multiples in the integrated analysis, Solo 
358 doublet detection algorithm was used to identify potential multiples.
359
360 Data integration of scRNA-seq datasets
361 To eliminate technical variations in samples derived from different studies and 
experiments, 52 samples were integrated to remove the batch effect by scVI 43 362 . scVI explicitly

363 formulates the batch effect as a latent variable in the deep generative model of observed 
364 expressions. Normalized expression was applied to detect highly variable genes (HVGs) using 
365 the Seurat algorithm (flavor: seurat). The “sampleID” was used as the batch key for calculating 
366 HVGs and the batch variable in the scVI modeling. The scVI model utilized 2 hidden layers 
367 (n_layers: 2) and a 30-dimensional latent space (n_latent: 30). The trained low-dimensional 
representation was used for cluster detection with the Leiden algorithm 44 368 . UMAP of lowdimensional visualization was generated by the Scanpy package 45 369 .
370
371 Cell clustering and cell type annotation
372 To annotate major classes of cell clusters, we incorporated well-annotated cell labels
373 released from public datasets, i.e., Yan et al. for ACs, Shekhar et al. for BCs, and Tran et al. and 
374 Jacobi et al. for RGCs. Cells from Yan et al. were annotated into 63 AC types. Cells from Shekhar 
375 et al. were 15 BC types showing in 14 clusters with small numbers of cells annotated as ACs, 
376 rod, and cone. Tran et al. cells were identified as 45 RGC types. The cell type labels of these 
377 well-annotated cells are used to annotate integrated cell clusters. To annotate isolated cell 
378 clusters that were isolated from existing cell labels of the public datasets, cluster-specific 
379 markers were examined from the top ranked genes generated by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test 
using the rank_genes_groups() function in the Scanpy package 45 380 .
381 To annotate subclass BC, AC, and RGC, subclass-specific cells were isolated and 
382 integrated using scVI. The generated low-dimensional embeddings were used to detect 
383 clusters using the Leiden algorithm. To determine the optimal number of clusters for 
384 subclasses, a two-level clustering approach was applied. In the first level of clustering, various 
385 resolutions were tested to achieve clustering without over-clustering in UMAP visualization. 
386 The second-level clustering refines the clusters from the first-level clusters by testing various 
387 resolutions to achieve optimal clustering without over-clustering on UMAP again. In the first388 level, Leiden clusters containing the majority of one type were annotated. When Leiden 
389 clusters contained more than one types, cells within the clusters were isolated. Within each 
390 subset of isolated cells, Leiden clusters were calculated again using the same low-dimensional 
391 embedding. The second-level Leiden clusters were examined for their cell label to determine 
392 their cell types.
393 To construct the BC atlas, data samples for BCs were integrated using scVI. Initially, 33 
394 clusters were identified, of which 30 could be matched and merged to individual BC types by 
examining previously generated cell labels and their known marker gene expression 11,24 395 , while 
396 the remaining 3 clusters (C30, C31, and C32) were excluded from the analysis as they 
397 contained non-BCs from previous annotation labels or had high UMI counts (Fig. 2a and 
398 Supplementary Fig. 2a-c). Consequently, 15 BC types were identified and annotated.
399 To construct the AC atlas, the data integration analysis for ACs using scVI identified a 
400 total of 71 clusters, of which 62 clusters could be matched and merged to 49 individual AC 
401 types via previous annotation labels and known marker expression. However, 8 clusters were 
402 over-clustered that contained two or more previous AC type labels, and one cluster (C70) was 
403 excluded from the AC reference due to non-AC cells (Supplementary Fig. 3c-d). To further 
404 address the 8 remaining over-clustered clusters (Supplementary Fig. 4a), we utilized a two405 level annotation approach. This involved isolating cells from each cluster and refining the 
406 clustering. The two-level annotation allowed the separation of the remaining 14 types: AC11, 
407 AC16, AC29, AC42, AC47, AC50, AC53, AC54, AC55, AC56, AC60, AC61, AC62, and AC63 
408 (Supplementary Fig. 4a-c). This revealed clusters that primarily consisted of RGCs, which have 
409 been removed in the integrated AC map (Supplementary Fig. 4c). As a result, 63 AC types were 
410 identified and annotated.
411 Three AC types, AC16, AC53, and AC62, were identified as dual types expressing both 
412 canonical GABAergic and glycinergic receptors in the study by Yan et al. AC16, however, was 
413 shown as a suspected doublet in their study, alongside AC60. Similarly, our UMAP showed 
414 loose cluster formation of AC16 and AC60 in proximity to each other, with relatively high UMI

415 counts (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 4e). In addition, our integrated UMAP showed AC53 
416 cells spread out in the middle of AC6 cells. Although the AC53 cluster was resolved in the 
417 second-level annotation, the loose clustering of AC53 cells is quite apparent. The third dual 
418 type, AC62, was also under-clustered and merged with AC42 and AC55. While AC62 was 
419 resolved in the second-level annotation, AC62 also appears near its neighboring cluster, AC42, 
420 in the UMAP. With very few cells being annotated as dual types in CD90.1 and Ma et al.
421 samples, which express high levels of Thy1 (data not shown), further validations of the dual 
422 types are required.
423 To construct the RGC atlas in the MRCA, the integrated analysis identified 54 clusters 
424 with an even distribution of cells from different data sources in most clusters (Supplementary 
425 Fig. 6a-d). Out of these clusters, 48 can be mapped and merged into 39 individual RGC types 
426 previously identified using marker gene expression and previous annotation labels 
427 (Supplementary Fig. 6a-b), while five clusters were over-clustered that contained multiple 
428 previous RGC types, and one cluster (C8) contained a mixture of several RGC type labels with 
429 high UMIs and was excluded from the downstream analysis as multiplets. To annotate the 
430 remaining seven types found in the five clusters with multiple labels, the second-level 
431 annotation was performed, which resulted in a clear separation of all 46 previously identified 
432 RGC types (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig.7a-c).
433
434 Differentially expressed gene analysis
435 To identify genes that are differentially expressed between cell types, we generated 
436 pseudo-bulk transcriptome of each annotated cell type in individual sample id. We used 
pyDESEQ2 46 437 to compare two clusters or types using the Wald test and identified genes 
438 specifically expressed in each cluster or type. Differentially expressed genes are identified 
439 under q-value < 0.05. The Wald statistics (log2FoldChange divided by lfcSE) was used to rank 
440 and select the top 10 genes expressed in each type.

Figure 1. Overview of single cell atlas of the mouse retina
(a) The workflow for generating unpublished scRNA-seq datasets. The data generation process involved 
using mice aged from P14 to 12 months. Following retina dissection and cell dissociation, single cells were 
enriched using autoMACS with Anti-CE73-PE antibodies or Anti-CD90.1 beads for specific amacrine, bipolar, 
and retinal ganglion cells. Subsequently, 10X single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on both the 
unenriched and enriched single cells. The retained single cells were then utilized in downstream atlas 
construction. (b) The integrated analysis workflow for constructing the MRCA. To construct a 
comprehensive unified single-cell reference of the mouse retina, we generated 16 unpublished scRNA-seq 
samples of the mouse retina and incorporated four curated public datasets to enhance specific amacrine, 
bipolar and retinal ganglion cells. The collected data were processed using the Cell Ranger and CellQC
pipeline to produce feature count matrices. Feature counts were then processed to remove estimated 
empty droplets, ambient RNA, and doublets. The retained cells were integrated using scVI to eliminate 
batch effects across samples. The trained low-dimensional embeddings were used to calculate cell 
dissimilarities and identify clustering through a two-level clustering approach. Major class and subclass cell 
types were annotated using canonical marker genes and public labeling. To facilitate user-friendly access 
and exploration, the MRCA was deployed on accessible interactive web browsers, including CELLxGENE, 
UCSC Cell Browser, and Single Cell Portal. (c) Pie chart displaying the percentage of cells contributed by each 
dataset used in the MRCA. (d) UMAP visualization of the MRCA colored by major classes. (e) Dot plot 
illustrating the expression of canonical markers for major classes.
